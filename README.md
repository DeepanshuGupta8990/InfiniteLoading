This project contains an HTML and CSS code that creates an animated circle effect using CSS animations. The circles are created with HTML <span> elements and styled using CSS to produce a visually appealing animation.

Preview
You can see the live preview of this project by opening the index.html file in a web browser.

How it works
The index.html file contains a simple HTML structure with two sets of circles, each having 21 spans representing the individual parts of the circle. The CSS animation is applied to these spans to create the animation effect.

The style.css file contains the styles required for creating the circles and the animation. The circles are styled using box-shadow and border-radius to achieve the circular shape with a glowing effect.

The animation is done using CSS keyframes. Each span has its own animation delay, scale, and hue rotation to produce a unique animation for each part of the circle.

Setup
Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Customization
You can customize the appearance of the circles and the animation by modifying the CSS in the style.css file. Here are some possible customizations:

Change the background color of the circles in the .circle span::before CSS block.
Adjust the size of the circles by changing the width and height properties of the .circle class.
Modify the animation duration or animation delays to change the speed of the animation.
Experiment with different box-shadow properties to create different glowing effects.
Browser Compatibility
This project uses CSS animations, which are widely supported by modern web browsers. However, for the best experience, it's recommended to use the latest versions of popular browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
